    - Comments and cleanup
    - Implement fixed (clamped) boundary conditions
    - Arbitrary numerical precision (research floating point precision)
        - 0.3 + 0.4 vs 0.2 + 0.4
        - Change python to use a set number of decimal points rather than bits, increases memory required
        - External libraries mp math or gmpy2
    - Optimize calculateMatrix.py (file that gets called the most)

    - structs -> calculateMatrix -> solver -> lambda_finder
